Infinite Scroll with Cursor Pagination & Indexing

Project Overview

This project demonstrates infinite scrolling with cursor-based pagination in a React frontend and a Node.js backend. It efficiently fetches large datasets by retrieving data in small chunks, improving performance and user experience.


Performance Benefits
✅ Faster Loading – Loads only required data instead of the entire dataset.
✅ Optimized Database Queries – Uses indexing to fetch data efficiently.
✅ Smooth User Experience – Data loads as needed, improving UX.
